Welcome to the classic Pong game, now in a **console text-based** version! It's simple, it's fun, and best of all, it works on both Windows and Unix systems! 🎉

## Features 🚀
- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against a simple AI that might just be better than you!
- **Two-Player Mode**: Grab a friend (or foe) and settle it with a good old Pong match.
- **Obstacles**: Randomly generated obstacles to make the game more... interesting. Try not to get hit!
- **High Scores**: Because what's Pong without bragging rights?
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Windows and Unix. Play wherever, whenever.

How to Play 🕹

Start the game.
Choose Solo Mode to play against the AI, or Two-Player Mode for a more personal competition.
Move the paddles: Player 1 uses z and s, Player 2 uses o and l.
Avoid the obstacles and try to score on your opponent!
Pause anytime with p and quit with q (but why would you do that?).
