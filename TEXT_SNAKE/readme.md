Snake Game: Detailed Functionalities Description
The Snake game is a classic arcade-style game where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with itself, walls, and obstacles. The objective is to make the snake as long as possible while navigating a grid-based playing field.

Key Functionalities:
Snake Movement:

The snake continuously moves in one direction, controlled by the player using arrow keys (or W, A, S, D for cross-platform versions).
The snake moves one unit at a time in the current direction, and new body parts are added to its head after consuming food.
Food and Growth:

A food item (X) is randomly placed on the grid. When the snake's head reaches the food, the snake grows by one unit.
After consuming food, a new food item spawns at a random location.
The snake's speed may increase with growth, making the game progressively harder.
Obstacles:

Optional obstacles (#) can be randomly placed on the grid, which the snake must avoid. If the snake collides with an obstacle, the game ends.
Collision Detection:

The game ends if the snake collides with the walls, obstacles, or itself. The snake’s body is stored in an array of positions, and each movement checks if the head hits any occupied part of its body or boundaries.
Upon collision, the player receives a "Game Over" message and their score is displayed.
Score Tracking:

The score is based on the number of food items consumed (the snake's length minus the starting size).
The current score is displayed during the game, and a final score is shown when the game ends.
Game Speed:

The snake's movement speed may start slow and gradually increase as the snake grows, adding difficulty over time.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:

The game can run on both Windows and Unix-based systems. Functions such as screen clearing (cls for Windows, clear for Unix) and timing (Sleep for Windows, usleep for Unix) are adapted for both platforms.
Sound Effects (Optional):

Sound effects can be added for specific events like eating food (a short high-pitched sound) and game over (a lower-pitched sound).
In cross-platform versions, Beep() is used on Windows, while Unix uses the terminal beep (\a).
Additional Features (For Enhanced Versions):
Obstacles: Randomly generated obstacles that appear on the playing field and must be avoided by the snake.
Game Difficulty: Increasing game speed with snake growth or adding multiple obstacles makes the game progressively harder.
Multiplayer Mode: Some versions may offer multiplayer functionality, where two players control two separate snakes on the same playing field.
This Snake Game provides a challenging and entertaining experience, with a core focus on strategic movement, avoiding self-collision, and maximizing the score by eating food. The game’s simple mechanics make it easily adaptable across platforms, and additional features like sound, obstacles, and increasing difficulty enhance gameplay.
