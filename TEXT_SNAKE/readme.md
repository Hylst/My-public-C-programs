# 🐍 SNAKE GAME 9000 - README

Welcome to the **Snake Game 9000**, the cutting-edge, next-gen, snake-controlling simulator you never knew you needed! This is not your average snake game, oh no. This is a **hardcore, cross-platform**, ASCII-fueled, beep-tastic snake experience. So get your hands on the keyboard and prepare for pixel-perfect precision (or random flailing) as you take control of the most powerful creature ever to crawl through a console window: the **@ Snake**!

## 🎮 Game Overview

It's simple, really. You control a snake. You eat food. You avoid walls, obstacles, your own tail, and the **other player** or **AI snake** who is coming for you! The more food you eat, the longer your snake gets, and the harder the game becomes. Classic, right? But there’s a twist! Actually, a lot of twists. 😜

Let’s break down the madness:

### 🐍 Snake Features:

1. **Solo Mode**:  
   Control your snake with the legendary `ZQSD` keys (why not WASD? Because this is Snake Game 9000, that’s why!). Eat the food, avoid obstacles, and most importantly, don’t eat your own tail. As you progress, the game throws more obstacles at you, and the snake speeds up! 🎯

2. **Duo Mode (VS Human)**:  
   It’s a snake showdown! Player 1 slithers around with `ZQSD`, and Player 2 uses the arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`). Who will eat the most food and survive the longest? Who will crash into an obstacle and claim the title of "Short Snake"? Find out!

3. **Duo Mode (VS AI)**:  
   Think you're the best snake around? Well, the **AI Snake** is here to challenge that. Choose between **three difficulty levels**: 
   
   - **Easy Mode**: The AI is basically blind. It moves in random directions, sometimes thinking about food, sometimes not. A good opponent for beginners, toddlers, and possibly your pet hamster. 🐹
   - **Medium Mode**: The AI knows where the food is and likes to eat, but it might occasionally forget about obstacles. A decent challenge for the aspiring snake master.
   - **Hard Mode**: AI Snake 9000 is sentient. It WILL find the food, and it WILL avoid you, the walls, the obstacles, and probably steal your lunch money. Are you ready for this kind of pressure? We’re not sure. 🧠

4. **Collisions**:  
   You know what happens when you run into yourself, the walls, or obstacles, right? You **lose**. In duo mode, if you run into the **other snake**, it’s a snake collision of epic proportions, and again, you **lose**.  
   But hey, **losing is part of life**, right? Just hit that replay button and show that snake who’s boss!

5. **Obstacles**:  
   As you progress through the levels, more and more obstacles are thrown onto the game board. These nasty little `#` characters love nothing more than to ruin your day. Will you dodge them like a pro or slam head-first into their trap? Either way, it's probably funny for the person watching you. 

### 🎵 Sound Features:
- **Beep Beep**:  
   Windows players get the joy of hearing **system beeps** every time you do something cool or crash horribly. Food = *high-pitched happy beep* 🎉. Crashing = *low, sad beep* 😢. Unix players... you get an **ASCII beep** (`\a`) because you're too cool for the Windows beep system.
   
- **No SDL Required**:  
   That's right, no fancy graphics libraries here! Just you, the terminal, and the soothing sound of beeps reminding you of the glory days of gaming.

### 🖥️ Cross-Platform Compatibility:
- Whether you're on Windows, Linux, macOS, or some obscure system you dug out of a museum, this game runs **everywhere** (ok, maybe not on your toaster, but we're working on that for Snake Game 9001).
- The game knows if you're on Windows or Unix-like systems and uses the appropriate commands to clear the screen and simulate beeps. 🎶

### 📊 Difficulty Levels (for AI):
- **Easy**: AI is like a toddler learning to walk—lots of random motion with a slight inclination towards food. You'll probably win.
- **Medium**: AI is more focused, but might forget that obstacles and walls are a thing. Sometimes, it’s like it just doesn’t care about surviving.
- **Hard**: The AI is so good, we're convinced it's thinking five steps ahead of you. It knows what you’re going to do before you do. Honestly, it’s terrifying.

### ⏸️ Pause Functionality:
- Need a break from all the snake action? Hit `P` to **pause** the game anytime. Grab a snack (or don’t, snakes don’t like sharing food), and return to your doom when you're ready.

### 💀 Game Over and Replay:
- When your snake inevitably meets a tragic end (or your AI nemesis slaughters you), the game will kindly let you know with a **Game Over** message. You can then choose to replay, curse the screen, or blame Player 2 for your loss.

### 🧠 Advanced Game Logic:
- **Growing Snake**: Every time you eat, your snake gets longer, but don’t get cocky! The longer you get, the harder it is to maneuver. The ultimate "eating yourself to death" simulator!
- **Randomized Obstacles**: Each new level adds a new, randomized obstacle to the board, just to keep you on your toes... or on your snake tail. 🐍

## 🎮 Controls:

- **Player 1 (Solo / Duo)**: 
  - Move Up: `Z`
  - Move Down: `S`
  - Move Left: `Q`
  - Move Right: `D`
  
- **Player 2 (Duo)**: 
  - Move Up: `↑`
  - Move Down: `↓`
  - Move Left: `←`
  - Move Right: `→`
  
- **Pause Game**: Press `P` to pause/resume.

## 🛠 Installation & How to Play:

### Windows:
1. Download the executable or compile the source code using your favorite compiler (we’re not picky).
2. Open the terminal (yeah, the command prompt is fine, don’t worry).
3. Run `snake_game.exe` and watch the magic happen.

### Linux/macOS:
1. Download the source code.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Compile with `gcc snake_game.c -o snake_game`.
4. Run the game with `./snake_game`.

### Tips for Success:
- Don't run into walls. Seriously, it's not a good look.
- The AI is evil in Hard mode. Proceed with caution.
- If Player 2 starts gloating, remind them that it's just a game... then beat them next round.
