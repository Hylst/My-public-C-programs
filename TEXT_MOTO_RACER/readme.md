# Moto Game: The Ultimate Test of Your (Virtual) Riding Skills or... not... ^^

**Because who needs a real motorcycle when you can ride a virtual one, right?**

## Features

* **Simple and fun ASCII art moto game:**  Because sometimes, less is more.
* **Avoid obstacles and vehicles:**  You're not a daredevil, are you?
* **Collect fuel to keep your moto running:**  Don't let your bike sputter out!
* **Earn points and survive as long as you can:**  How long can you last before you crash and burn?

## Requirements

* **A C compiler (gcc or clang):**  Because you need something to turn code into magic.
* **A terminal or console:**  Because who wants to play a game on a fancy GUI?

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Clone this repository:** Because you need the code to play the game.
2. **Compile the code with the command `gcc -o moto_game moto_game.c`:**  Because magic is made with code.
3. **Run the game with the command `./moto_game`:**  Because now it's time to ride!

## Controls

* **A/D:** Move your moto left or right.
* **W/S:** Move your moto up or down.
