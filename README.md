# my-C-Cpp-and_other_languages-code
I'll share here my public C and C++ code i'm authorized & abble to find back. 
Mostly on PC, but also for embeded electronics.
You'll find here :
- Hylst Personal Butler : a multiservice console program
- A dice rolling Simulator
- A basic Passion Profile checker in console mode
- A mini text RPG
- Cochon : An animated nice looking pinky whirlpool
- Tunnel : Kind of a Tunnel Effect of Demoscene
- Vagues : A progressive picture display effect by bitmap waves
- Bitmap filtering scripts with convolutions matrix and more

Many of theses programs were coded > 20 years ago. 
I have improved the presentation ( comments / format / structure / variables & functions names / ...), 
updated, clarified the code for several of them for public release.
I'll try to find my others old programs and share them here, too.
