This updated version of the program adds Sharpen filtering and fully implements the filtering logic for each filter type. The program uses SDL2 to load, manipulate, and display the images, and applies the following filters:

Gaussian Blur
Edge Detection
Motion Blur
Emboss
Mean Filter
Median Filter
Sharpen
Each filter can be applied based on the user's menu selection, and the original and filtered images are displayed side by side. Here's the added functionality:

Sharpen Filter: Defined using a 3x3 kernel, it enhances edges to make the image clearer.
Filtering Logic: All filters are implemented and can be selected from the menu.
UI Enhancements: The original and filtered images are displayed on the screen, and text explanations accompany the filters.
